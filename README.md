# Digit-Recognition

My project is a Handwritten Digit Recognition Model that utilizes Artificial Neural Networks and Tensorflow. By training a neural network on the MNIST dataset, it is capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits. When fed with test data, the model identifies and outputs the most appropriate digit, enabling efficient digit recognition and classification.
